# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis 
The purpose of our analysis is to determine the numer of retiring employees by title and to identify which employees are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. 

## Results
- By creating the retirements titles table, we are able to see every employee that iis eligible for retirement along with how long they have worked at each position throughout their career.
- By creating the unique titles table, we are able to see the most recent title for employees of retirement age (Senior Engineer).
- By creating a table showing an employee's eligibility to participate in the mentorship program, we are able to see that majority of these employees have been in their position for at least 5 years. This allows us to predict that the employees who participate will be able to share years of valuable experience and lessons learned to the program.

## Summary  
 In summary and thanks to the tables created, we see that 90,398 roles will need to be filled as the worforce begings to retire. Additionally, we also learn that considering the high number of roles beginning to clear out compared to the 1,940 employees eligible to participate in the mentorship program, there are not enough qualified and retirement-ready employees in the departments to ensure the next generation of Pewlett-Hackard are well-prepared.
